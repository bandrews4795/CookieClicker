Cookie Clicker Mods
This mod is a cheat mod for the game Cookie Clicker beta at http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/beta/.
It is a slower cheat which allows time to get all of the acheivements (somewhat) legitimately.
It increases your cookies per second (Cps) passively and actively. It passively doubles your cookies per second over time, this slows down after a cap to prevent the game from going into Infinity and making the game unplayable. Actively, it increases your Cps per click, doubling at a certain rate as well. The active increase does not cap. It also increases the spawn rate of Golden Cookies, Reindeer (During Christmas), Sugar lumps, and optionally Wrinklers. These are harder to quantify because of the calculations that go into them, but I believe I set them at a useful rate.
It also compensates for time played and clicks already done. It's not perfect, so if you refresh and reload it then the multiplier drops some. To compensate, it spawns a golden cookie and sugar lumps whenever you reload it. It's a lot better than starting at 0 again and having to wait for the multiplier to tick up.


This mod can be added to cookie clicker by copying the following code into a bookmark and opening it during a game:

javascript: (function () {
	Game.LoadMod('https://bandrews4795.github.io/CookieClicker/CookieGameBreak.js');
}());
